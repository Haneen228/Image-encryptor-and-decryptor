Image Encryptor and Decryptor
A Python-based GUI application that encrypts and decrypts image files using a simple XOR operation, built with Tkinter. This tool allows users to protect and unprotect their images by applying a unique encryption key.

Features
Simple Encryption/Decryption: Apply an XOR operation on images (.jpg, .jpeg, .png, .gif) using a user-defined integer key.
Key Validation: Ensures the correct key is used for decryption to prevent unauthorized access.
User-Friendly Interface: A Tkinter GUI with modern styling and hover effects for a better user experience.
Log Display: Provides real-time logs of encryption and decryption status for easy monitoring.
Technology Stack
Python: Core programming language.
Tkinter: For building the GUI.
